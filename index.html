    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>Huiyan Luo is a designer from Canton, currently based in London. Studying Interaction Design at the London College of Communication, she moves between the digital and the tangible, tracing how landscapes are shaped not only by nature but also by perception, technology, and desire.<br>
Her practice weaves together digital media, interactive systems, and observation to question how humans, environments, and non-human agents co-exist within the circuitry of the contemporary world.</p>

    <h3>Caution! The 'Klein Loop'</h3>
    <p>As social media becomes a vehicle for self-presentation, does it better help us with identity construction and identification? People tend to use alt-accounts to regain the initiative of self. In the expression of multiple identities, the real self is broken into pieces. Can we still maintain our authentic expression in the face of different expectations from different accounts?</p>

    <h3>The Lotus' Narrative</h3>
    <p>The world of the Lotus Eaters is a tranquil haven that rejects grand narratives, embodying a longing to resist binary opposition and the suppression of individuality. With the realm of the Lotus Eaters, I try to reveal the profound significance of personal experiences and micro-narratives, ultimately choosing to stay and abandon collective conformity.</p>

  <div class="project">
    <h3>100￥ Challenge</h3>
    <p>Inspired by the "100 Yuan Challenge" incident on China's largest food delivery platform, this project tries to reveal hidden labor exploitation, platform capitalism, and shifting responsibility. An interactive installation immerses the audience in the role of a delivery worker, highlighting the struggles of self-worth under platform-driven pressures and the unconscious exploitation by consumers.</p>
